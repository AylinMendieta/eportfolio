    <h1>Mystery Black Box Investigation</h1>
<h4>By: Aylin Mendieta Yahuitl</h4>
<h2>Background Information About The Mystery Black Box</h2>
<p>In the New Media and Tech. for Social Change class, students are trying to experiment, develop, and create different methods to explain their thoughts about what is inside the mystery box. The mystery box is a box that was built in Mr. Sinusas’s class. The mystery box causes the amount of liquid to change. Our goal during this investigation was to know what was causing the amount of water to change. We also were trying to design a similar box trying to imitate the original. We collected data to analyze how it change.
</p>
<h2>Claim</h2>
<p>Inside of the box there is a container connected with a tube that is positioned after 1000mL of water.</p>
<h2>Evidence</h2>
<p>The original mystery box causes the amount of water to change. For example we pour 1000mL and it change into 712mL. We notice that it took a lot for the water to come out. Also we notice that the water would take more or less time depending on the amount.</p>

<p>Our mystery box trials worked perfectly. Our box took two days to get final design, some of our first attempts failed because the materials were position wrong or we didn’t have enough glue. We had less water and more water in every trial. For example we pour 1000mL and it change into
870mL.</p>

<h3>Reasoning, Part 1</h3>
<p>Models are designs created by us or others to give an idea of how a prototype will work.  Models are useful to represent an idea to then turn it into a physical or we may design it in computer to collect data or just test it. Our limits are that our models may not be accurate and may affect results. Making a physical project it’s difficult because we don't get the same result as we were expecting to get.</p>

<h3>Reasoning, Part 2</h3>
<p>Each time that we pour 1000mL exact nothing happens even if we wait for a hole hour. When we add more, the water comes out. Our evidence is correct because we pour an exact amount that was not exactly 1000mL but we try to get close so it wouldn’t come out as the real mystery box. It happened the same thing that happens when we pour 1000mL into the mystery box meaning that our thoughts were correct.</p>

<h3>Reasoning, Part 3</h3>
<p>Inside the mystery box there is a box that when it gets to a certain weight it makes water to come out and then it closes. Our time variable would have change into a weight variable. We would have gotten different numbers, more high numbers than less numbers. It would have change the hole procedure and affect the model because we would have need to use different materials and connect them in way that the prototype would work without no one touching it.</p>

<h2>3D Modeling, Animation, and Augmented Reality</h2>

<p>We use the Maya program to model, design,
and animated our mystery black box. The project started with a
 snowman since we didn't know how to use the program. The next class
 we started the box modeling in Maya. We started with basic shapes to start the
 box, then we started to use different tools such as extrude to give shape to
the objects. Then we design the tube and make the hole to were the tube would
go through. We added color, and the final step was animation. The animation was easy but
 if you made a mistake you would have to do it again till it looks as you want it to look. It was harder when
modeling the water, but I wasn't able to get to that part since I was behind.</p>

<p>Using augmented reality was also easy we just had to download the box that we made in
maya in a program called Merge Edu. In Merge Edu we labeled our project and gather more information
about it, to then create a QR code that would help us get a 3D model. When matching the same QR code to a cube that would help us see our box from every angle
depending on the cube position. That was all the project we did, and finally here are some examples
of practice models that we use to show our knowledge and also the mystery box. </p>

<h2>Examples of Models That We used for Practice</h2>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<h4>It was a big project it took over two months two finish it and teamwork was the greatest challenge,
it was hard to give a task to someone since we where four, but using the collaboration contract helped us a lot.
We used the collaboration contract to give task and make sure everyone knew what to do and if they where lost we would know how to help them.</h4>

<h4> In this project I contributed mostly in taking pictures, providing materials when needed, and testing, since my other two classmates build the box and the third classmate was finishing the collaboration contract.</h4>

style="width:400px;height:300px;">


<h4> Once we were done we started using Maya to create our 3D mystery box. We learned how to use different tools but it was hard, I was getting lost since I didn't really understood how to the different tools and so I wasn't able to finish my 3d model. I think that I mastered animation since it was the easiest thing we learned in Maya. When we were done with Maya we used Merge Edu to model our box in 3D. After being done with Merged Edu we started our program, the program was hard. We learned how to use codes, but the hardest thing was saving it since the second day I missed most of the class because I couldn't open my project. We also learned how to decorate, center, make tables, add color, add fonts and more. Also html was useful because it helped me with pictures and decorating my program. This program was hard, I had difficult moments but at the I was able to enjoy it and learn something that I had never done. I think that if we do a similar project in the future I'm going to feel more comfortable since I dominate more using the different programs.</h4>

<h2> 21st Century Skills</h2>

<h4> I think that my 21st century skill for this project was "Problem Solving and Critical Thinking". During this project I faced different challenges, the most difficult part for me was designing the 3D box in Maya. I was thinking about everything I could add to make it similar to my group's original box. I also had to change different things because they were not working, for example the tube because it looked weird and it was not working as I wanted. I was able to improve my design and even thought I was not able to finish I tried and kept going till the end.</h4>
